...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Blackened,Metallica,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blackened is the end, winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never her rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend
Never

[Chorus]
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Verse 2]
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore
Never

[Chorus]
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),...And Justice for All,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay

[Chorus]
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Verse 2]
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Eye of the Beholder,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Do you see what I see? Truth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

[Verse 2]
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),One,Metallica,"[Spoken Intro]
""Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!""

[Instrumental Intro: 0:19 - 1:46]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),The Shortest Straw,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witch-hunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eyeâ€™s disgrace
Defying commonplace
Unending paper chase
Unending

[Pre-Chorus]
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

[Chorus]
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witch-hunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
[Post-Chorus]
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

[Verse 2]
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You're living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

[Pre-Chorus]
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Harvester of Sorrow,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
My life suffocates, planting the seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate, trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth, you've turned this lie to truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery, you'll suffer unto me

[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow

[Verse 2]
Pure black looking clear, my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in, let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain, your loss becomes my gain

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery, you'll suffer unto me

[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),The Frayed Ends of Sanity,Metallica,"[Intro]
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee ohh

[Verse 1]
Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

[Chorus]
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),To Live Is to Die,Metallica,"[Instrumental (0:00 - 7:33)]

[Interlude]
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?

[Instrumental (7:50 - 9:49)]"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Dyers Eve,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

[Verse 2]
Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

[Refrain]
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

[Verse 3]
Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance
"
