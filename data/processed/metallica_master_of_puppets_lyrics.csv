Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Battery,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Master of Puppets,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),The Thing That Should Not Be,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

[Verse 2]
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Welcome Home (Sanitarium),Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""rage""?

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Disposable Heroes,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

[Verse 2]
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Leper Messiah,Metallica,"[Intro: Lars Ulrich]
One, two
One, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Orion,Metallica,This song is an instrumental
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),"Damage, Inc.",Metallica,"[Bass Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard, and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Verse 2]
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood, and we make sure
Life isn't for you, and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name, and you shall fall
"
