Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Welcome to the Jungle,Guns N’ Roses,"[Intro]
Oh my God
Ooh-ooh
Cha

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream

Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Sweet Child O’ Mine,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by
"
Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Patience,Guns N’ Roses,"[Intro: Duff McKagan]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it, we won't fake it
Oh, I'll never break it 'cause I can't take it
"
Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Paradise City,Guns N’ Roses,"[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

[Verse 2]
Rags to riches, or so they say
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Use Your Illusion II,Civil War,Guns N’ Roses,"[Spoken Intro: Strother Martin]
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

[Bridge]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
"
Use Your Illusion II,You Could Be Mine,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine, aw

[Verse 2]
Now, holidays come and then they go
It's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars, I'm home again

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line (Aw)
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine
"
Use Your Illusion I,Don’t Cry,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?

[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 2]
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby

And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

Use Your Illusion I,November Rain,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

[Chorus]
Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
"
Use Your Illusion I,Live and Let Die,Guns N’ Roses,"[Pre-Chorus]
When you were young, and your heart was an open book
You used to say, ""Live and let live""
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say, ""Live and let die""
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

[Guitar Solo]

You used to say, ""Live and let live""
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
"
Use Your Illusion II,Yesterdays,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday, there was so many things I was never told
Now that I'm starting to learn, I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along with no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better if we'd all just let them be

[Chorus]
Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Got nothing for me, ooh, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly, this time I found I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties
"
Greatest Hits,Ain’t It Fun,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Ain't it fun when you're always on the run?
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become?
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well, that you, you just can't cum?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun

[Chorus]
Good fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah, fun, such fun, such
Ow

[Verse 2]
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one?
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun?
Ain't it fun when you - just - can't seem to find your tongue?
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, somebody come up to me, and spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast
"
Greatest Hits,Since I Don’t Have You,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
I don't have plans and schemes
And I don't have hopes and dreams
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

[Verse 2]
And I don't have fond desires
And I don't have happy hours
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you (I don't have)

[Bridge]
Happiness and I guess
I never will again
When you walked out on me
In walked old misery
And he's been here since then

[Interlude]
Yep, we're fucked!

[Verse 3]
I don't have love to share
And I don't have one who cares
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you
"
Greatest Hits,Sympathy for the Devil,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, haha

...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Blackened,Metallica,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Blackened is the end, winter it will send
Throwing all you see into obscurity
Death of Mother Earth, never her rebirth
Evolution's end, never will it mend
Never

[Chorus]
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened

[Verse 2]
Blistering of Earth, terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine kills what might have been
Callous frigid chill, nothing left to kill
Never seen before, breathing nevermore
Never

[Chorus]
Fire to begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackened
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),...And Justice for All,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Halls of justice painted green, money talking
Power wolves beset your door, hear them stalking
Soon you'll please their appetite, they devour
Hammer of justice crushes you, overpower

[Pre-Chorus]
The ultimate in vanity
Exploiting their supremacy
I can't believe the things you say
I can't believe, I can't believe the price
You pay

[Chorus]
Nothing can save you
Justice is lost, justice is raped, justice is gone
Pulling your strings, justice is done
Seeking no truth, winning is all
Find it so grim, so true, so real

[Verse 2]
Apathy their stepping stone, so unfeeling
Hidden deep animosity, so deceiving
Through your eyes their light burns, hoping to find
Inquisition sinking you with prying minds
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Eye of the Beholder,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Do you see what I see? Truth is an offense
Your silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

[Pre-Chorus]
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

[Chorus]
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

[Verse 2]
Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),One,Metallica,"[Spoken Intro]
""Fuckin' coward! Get your ass out of that trench!
Move, move, move, move, move!
Oh shit, oh fuck!
I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit!""

[Instrumental Intro: 0:19 - 1:46]

[Verse 1]
I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel the scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

[Chorus]
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

[Verse 2]
Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),The Shortest Straw,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Suspicion is your name
Your honesty to blame
Put dignity to shame
Dishonor
Witch-hunt, modern day
Determining decay
The blatant disarray
Disfigure
The public eye’s disgrace
Defying commonplace
Unending paper chase
Unending

[Pre-Chorus]
Deafening
Painstaking
Reckoning
This vertigo it doth bring

[Chorus]
Shortest straw
Challenge liberty
Downed by law
Live in infamy
Rub you raw
Witch-hunt riding through
Shortest straw
This shortest straw has been pulled for you
[Post-Chorus]
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Pulled for you (Shortest straw)
Shortest straw has been pulled for you

[Verse 2]
The accusations fly
Discrimination, why?
Your inner self to die
Intruding
Doubt sunk itself in you
Its teeth and talons through
You're living Catch-22
Deluding
A mass hysteria
A megalomania
Reveal dementia
Reveal

[Pre-Chorus]
Secretly
Silently
Certainly
In vertigo you will be
"
...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Harvester of Sorrow,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
My life suffocates, planting the seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate, trapped far beyond my fate
I give, you take this life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth, you've turned this lie to truth

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery, you'll suffer unto me

[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow

[Verse 2]
Pure black looking clear, my work is done soon here
Try getting back to me, get back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in, let the beatings begin
Distributor of pain, your loss becomes my gain

[Pre-Chorus]
Anger, misery, you'll suffer unto me

[Chorus]
Harvester of sorrow (Language of the mad)
Harvester of sorrow

Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee oh
Oh wee oh, wee ohh

[Verse 1]
Never hunger, never prosper
I have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within, triggered again
Now the candle burns at both ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Twisting under schizophrenia
Falling deep into dementia

[Chorus]
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me

...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),To Live Is to Die,Metallica,"[Instrumental (0:00 - 7:33)]

[Interlude]
When a man lies, he murders some part of the world
These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives
All this I cannot bear to witness any longer
Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?

...And Justice for All (Deluxe Box Set),Dyers Eve,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Dear mother, dear father
What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

[Verse 2]
Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

[Refrain]
Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

[Verse 3]
Dear mother, dear father
Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Battery,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Master of Puppets,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see
More is all you need
Dedicated to
How I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),The Thing That Should Not Be,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

[Verse 2]
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell

Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Welcome Home (Sanitarium),Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says ""rage""?

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
"
Master of Puppets (Deluxe Box Set),Disposable Heroes,Metallica,"[Verse 1]
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

[Verse 2]
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get the better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain

Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see

[Verse 1]
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard, and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Verse 2]
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood, and we make sure
Life isn't for you, and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name, and you shall fall
