Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Welcome to the Jungle,Guns N’ Roses,"[Intro]
Oh my God
Ooh-ooh
Cha

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the jungle, we got fun and games
We got everything you want, honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
Watch it bring you to your sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-knees, knees
Mwah, I, I wanna watch you bleed

[Verse 2]
Welcome to the jungle, we take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed, but it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl, who's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights, but you won't get there for free

[Chorus]
In the jungle, welcome to the jungle (Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-
Feel my, my, my, my serpentine
Oh, ah, I wanna hear you scream

Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Sweet Child O’ Mine,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro/Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky (Sky)
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long, I'd probably break down and cry

[Chorus]
Woah, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes and see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place
Where, as a child, I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me by

Appetite for Destruction (Super Deluxe Edition),Patience,Guns N’ Roses,"[Intro: Duff McKagan]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you, I'm still alright to smile
Girl, I think about you every day now
Was a time when I wasn't sure but you set my mind at ease
There is no doubt you're in my heart now

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine
All we need is just a little patience
Said, sugar, make it slow and we'll come together fine
All we need is just a little patience
Patience, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sit here on the stairs 'cause I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait, dear
Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider

[Chorus]
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it, we won't fake it
Oh, I'll never break it 'cause I can't take it

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

[Verse 2]
Rags to riches, or so they say
You gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Use Your Illusion II,Civil War,Guns N’ Roses,"[Spoken Intro: Strother Martin]
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So you get what we had here last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

[Bridge]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
"
Use Your Illusion II,You Could Be Mine,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothin' new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine, aw

[Verse 2]
Now, holidays come and then they go
It's nothin' new today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars, I'm home again

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line (Aw)
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothin' done
I said, you could be mine

Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?

And don't you cry tonight

Use Your Illusion I,November Rain,Guns N’ Roses,"[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same? Yeah

Nothin' lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

Use Your Illusion I,Live and Let Die,Guns N’ Roses,"[Pre-Chorus]
When you were young, and your heart was an open book
You used to say, ""Live and let live""

Use Your Illusion II,Yesterdays,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Yesterday, there was so many things I was never told
Now that I'm starting to learn, I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along with no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better if we'd all just let them be

[Chorus]
Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Got nothing for me, ooh, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly, this time I found I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties

Greatest Hits,Ain’t It Fun,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Ain't it fun when you're always on the run?
Ain't it fun when your friends despise what you've become?
Ain't it fun when you get so high, well, that you, you just can't cum?
Ain't it fun when you know that you're gonna die young?
It's such fun

[Chorus]
Good fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah fun, such fun, such fun, ah
Yeah, fun, such fun, such
Ow

[Verse 2]
Ain't it fun when you're taking care of number one?
Ain't it fun when you feel like you just gotta get a gun?
Ain't it fun when you - just - can't seem to find your tongue?
'Cause you stuck it too deep into something that really stung
It's such fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, somebody come up to me, and spit right in my face
I didn't even feel it, it was such a disgrace
I punched my fist right through the glass
I didn't even feel it, it happened so fast

And I don't have happy hours

In walked old misery

And I don't have one who cares
I, I, I don't have anything
Since I don't have you

Greatest Hits,Sympathy for the Devil,Guns N’ Roses,"[Verse 1]
Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith

And I was around when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

[Verse 2]
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
I killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, oh yeah
But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, haha
